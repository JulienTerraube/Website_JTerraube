      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am a Researcher in animal ecology and biodiversity conservation at the Office Français de la Biodiversité (OFB). I collect, manage and analyse long-term data to understand the impacts of global change on vertebrates at different scales, from individuals to communities. My research focuses on three main areas: i) integrating multidimensional data to understand species' responses to environmental change (natural or anthropogenic) at different levels of organisation; ii) assessing the interactive effects of human threats such as climate change and land use change on biodiversity; iii) improving methods for evaluating the effectiveness of conservation measures. My aim is to use robust quantitative methods to influence conservation policy and practice. I currently focus on the adaptative management of exploited populations at OFB.
